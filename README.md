# Piranha
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

The above video and following description describe the purpose and creation of CodeWithEggly and sgsmi's CS50 final project, the Piranha.
Piranha will be a script that will notify us, via email or otherwise, of new listings on OpenSea. It will do this by utilisting *what?* from OpenSea's Stream API. 
There will be options for narrowing the script's alerts to specific collections and to within a specific price range

**For the moment this can be our TODO list**

Upon *Initialising*:
- [ ] Check Value of our wallet
- [ ] Open database
- [ ] Connect to OpenSea Stream API
